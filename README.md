# Temp_Sensing_Prototype
This is a simple arduino based temperature sensing circuit which reads the temperature of its surroundings and displays it on a 16x2 LCD screen. The circuit was designed as a prototype to temperature controlling mechanism for centrally air-conditioned premises. The range of optimum temperature range can be fed to the microcontroller board. If the sensed tempearture dows not fall in set range, the led and buzzer turn on which indicate that control mechanism should be activated. The control could be manual as or automatic.
